Overview
--------
This role installs and manages the Apache HTTPD Web Server

Requirements
------------
This role requires Ansible 2.1 or higher and platform requirements are listed in the [metadata](meta/main.yml) file.

If you are using SSL/TLS you should provided your own certificate and key files.  By default it will use the localhost certificate and key created by the system.

Variable Overrides
------------------

Varibles listed as a key with no values in `defaults/main.yml` can be overriden via group or extra variables yet still set a default value via OS-specific variable includes ( see `vars/*.yml` ).

This is accomplished via the `set_overrides.yml` task file which determines if a value is passed to the role or if the value is `None` and then initializes the variable with a default value from the OS-specific variable includes

Role Variables
--------------
The variables that can be passed to this role and a brief description about them are as follows. (For all variables, take a look at defaults/main.yml)

> See [Variable Overrides](#variable-overrides) for information on variables not listed with a default value and the ability to override them via pass-ins.

```yaml
apache_packages:
```
The set of packages to be installed. 

```yaml
apache_service:
```
The service name for the apache daemon to run on the system.

```yaml
apache_state:
```
The Apache daemon state to be enforced. This should generally remain the default value.

```yaml

  - ::1
```
Array of hosts allowed to access the Apache status page.  Defaults to localhost via IPv4 and IPv6

### VirtualHosts

### Virtualhost Dict Keys: Defaults

All default Apache VirtualHost entries are removed during the running of this play and declaired VirtualHosts are generated. Overridden inside the `apache_vhosts` variable on a per Virtualhost basis within the dict.

```yaml
apache_vhosts_template: vhostsj2
```
```yaml
apache_vhosts:
  - server_name: "example.mysite.com"
    template: "../path/to/custom/template"
```
The template used for generating VirtualHost configurations. This can be used to call a custom template if desired per VirtualHost. Overridden inside the `apache_vhosts` variable on a per Virtualhost basis within the dict.

 ```yaml
 apache_vhost_ssl: True
 ```
Enables SSL for the virtual host. SSL virtual hosts only respond to HTTPS queries.  Defaults to True, SSL should be used everywhere!! Overridden inside the `apache_vhosts` variable on a per Virtualhost basis within the dict.

```yaml
apache_ssl_certs_dir:
```
The directory containing Certificates of Certification Authorities (CAs), used for SSl/TLS configuration. This should generally remain the default value. Overridden inside the `apache_vhosts` variable on a per Virtualhost basis within the dict.

```yaml
apache_ssl_default_cert:
```
The PEM-encoded certificate file, used for SSL/TLS configuration. Defaults are based on local certificate generated by your OS. Overridden inside the `apache_vhosts` variable on a per Virtualhost basis within the dict.

```yaml
apache_ssl_default_key:
```
The PEM-encoded private key file, used for SSL/TLS configuration. Defaults are based on local certificate generated by your OS. Overridden inside the `apache_vhosts` variable on a per Virtualhost basis within the dict.

```yaml
apache_vhost_ip: '*'
```
IP address the virtual host listens on.  Default behavior of listening on all IPs. Overridden inside the `apache_vhosts` variable on a per Virtualhost basis within the dict.

```yaml
apache_vhost_port: '443'
```
Port the Virtualhost is configured to listen on.  Defaults to 443. Overridden inside the `apache_vhosts` variable on a per Virtualhost basis within the dict.

### Virtualhost Dict Keys

```yaml
apache_vhosts:
  - server_name: 
```
Sets the Apache server name via Apache's ServerName directive.

```yaml
apache_vhosts:
